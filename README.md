## Bar One

This is a REPL game that offers a satirical and comedic way to "practice" meeting people at bars. This game is not intended to be mean, offensive, demeaning, or lascivious. Sometime we just need to laugh at ourselves.

If you want a laugh, have a play!

## Setup
Bar One is a game that is played locally through the command line. To play, you will first need to clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/melonious/REPL_Game.git`

Next, all you need to do is `cd` into the directory and run the ruby file:

`ruby bar_one.rb`

Enjoy!

## About Bar One
Bar One was created as my very first weekend project at [Wyncode Academy](https://wyncode.co/), a nine-week, intensive, full-stack web development bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment was to practice looping and, primarily, to further familiarize ourselves with writing methods.
